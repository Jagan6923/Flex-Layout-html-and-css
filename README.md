# Flex-Layout-html-and-css
I do an assignment by using html and css.This assignment was given by the LETS UPGRADE html bootcamp.
Design and implement an HTML structure for a responsive card layout using Flexbox.

Apply CSS styles to achieve the following requirements:

Each card should have a title, an image, and some text content.

The cards should be displayed in a grid-like layout using Flexbox.

The cards should be horizontally centered within the container.

Each card should have equal width and height.

Add appropriate spacing between the cards using margins or padding.

The cards should adjust their layout and size based on different screen sizes for a responsive design.
